I am professor at LIRIS lab where a I lead the research group on <a href="https://projet.liris.cnrs.fr/dm2l/">Data Mining and Machine Learning</a>. I design exploratory data analysis methods by hybridizing numerical machine learning and symbolic reasoning techniques. Numerical machine learning methods excel at learning complex, noise-resistant models but are often opaque, intricate, and difficult to validate. In contrast, symbolic methods provide interpretable justifications for their results and are easier to explain, but they tend to be sensitive to noise and lack scalability. By integrating symbolic reasoning with neural networks, my work seeks to combine the strengths of both approaches while mitigating their respective limitations.

My research journey began with the development of pattern enumeration algorithms for constrained data mining. It subsequently expanded to the analysis of static and dynamic graphs. More recently, I have focused on hybridizing pattern mining with statistical machine learning methods. This includes constraining models to better leverage richer data and enhancing their interpretability.


Organisation & Invited Talks
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Grants
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
