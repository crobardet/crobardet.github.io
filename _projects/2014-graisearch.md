Use of Graphics Rendering and Artificial Intelligence for Improved Mobile Search Capabilities

GRAISearch is an Industry-Academia Partnerships and Pathways project (IAPP) aiming at transferring knowledge from Academia to Industries. It is also a support for training and career development of researchers (Marie Curie).

The principal aim of this project is to develop and apply revolutionary graphics rendering and artificial intelligence (AI) methods to an existing social media search engine platform thereby creating ground breaking mobile search capabilities with significant online commercial potential.

Technologies from research in two academic institutions (INSA de Lyon (LIRIS UMR CNRS 5205) and Trinity College Dublin (TCD)), will be transfered into the products of Tapastreet LTD, the Dublin based Web startup.
