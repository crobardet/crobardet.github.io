The project consider improving animal welfare (AW), recognized as a key element for the sustainability of livestock production systems. The environmental conditions in the coming years will be more variable due to the consequences of the global warming, and will have even wider effects on animals reared in AE systems (less optimized, outdoor conditions). This makes the development of new assessment tools of AW and of decision tools even more useful than at present, in order to adopt AE practices improving AW. Strategies to improve AW are highly dependent on the measurements of traits underlying physiology, behavior and perception of the animal when facing various challenges. The project WAIT4 will exploit new opportunities offered by digital technologies to monitor the different components of AW in real time, and will develop new approaches in artificial intelligence to consider large sets of heterogeneous data collected through these equipment on/in/around the animal.
