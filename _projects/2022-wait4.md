<p>The project aims to enhance animal welfare (AW), a key component of sustainable livestock production systems. As environmental conditions become increasingly variable due to the impacts of global warming, the effects on animals raised in agroecological transition systems --characterized by less optimized and more variable outdoor conditions -- are expected to intensify. This underscores the growing need for innovative tools to assess AW and support decision-making, enabling the adoption of agroecological practices that promote animal well-being.
</p>

<p>Strategies to improve AW rely heavily on accurately measuring traits related to an animal’s physiology, behavior, and perception when facing various challenges. The WAIT4 project will leverage advancements in digital technologies to enable real-time monitoring of these diverse components of AW. Furthermore, it will employ cutting-edge artificial intelligence approaches to integrate and analyze large, heterogeneous datasets collected from and around the animals, facilitating more informed and effective interventions to enhance their welfare.</p>
