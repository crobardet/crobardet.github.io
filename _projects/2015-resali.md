<p>The primary scientific goal of the <a href="https://imu.msh-lse.fr/projet/resali-reseaux-et-systeme-alimentaire-systemes-dinformation-innovants-et-exploratoires-pour-plus-de-justice-alimentaire-dans-les-metropoles/)">RESALI</a> 
 is to study the food networks and system. </p>

Objectives of the Project:
=====

Feeding cities, particularly large urban agglomerations, both in quantity and quality, represents a significant challenge for the future of urban environments, especially in the context of sustainability and food justice.  

At the scale of urban food systems, there is a need for diagnostics to systematically understand the relationships between consumption hubs, food supply, and dietary behaviors. The RESALI project aims to test methods and tools for a detailed analysis of the organization of urban food systems, exploring the connections and disconnections between food supply and demand—essentially, between food resources and certain consumption basins, including the most marginalized and least informed populations.  

The project brings together geographers, computer scientists, and practitioners involved in Lyon's food systems to develop an innovative information system for the Lyon-St-Etienne metropolitan area. This system will integrate structural data (such as census and commerce data) and large-scale individual data, including consumption data and VGI (Volunteered Geographic Information) from user-generated Web 2.0 content.  

Methodology:
=====

The project is based on a combination of three innovative methodological approaches:

1. **Developing an information system** to identify imbalances in the distribution of food resources, access to food, and food consumption behaviors. This will be contextualized within the socio-spatial inequalities of the region.  
   
2. **Advancing spatial data mining methods** to extract insights about individual practices from geo-located web data (notably from social media platforms like Twitter). This exploratory objective operates under the hypothesis that big data processing approaches in computer science can benefit from integrating spatial analysis models. This aspect will form the core of a doctoral thesis in data science.  

3. **Incorporating conceptual and systemic reflection** into the empirical approach to model the food system. The goal is to use this model to develop scenarios targeting proximity, based on the hypothesis that the supply and demand for local products within a food system not only encourage behavioral diversification but may also create new forms of food injustice.  

Expected Outcomes:
=====

Grounded in an interdisciplinary approach, the scientific contributions of the RESALI project will be significant for each of the involved disciplines. These contributions will span methodologies (data mining, enhancement of mining models with spatial analysis models, and spatial analysis using geonumeric data) and issues related to food justice.  

The project's findings on the territorial architecture of food resources and consumption practices—particularly as seen through the lens of social media—will be submitted and discussed at the scale of the Lyon-St-Etienne metropolitan area or specific neighborhoods/sub-spaces within it.  

The project aims to demonstrate that food resources are critical sites for ecological, social, and territorial innovation in urban contexts and must be factored into the planning and development of future urban environments.

  project (Use of Graphics Rendering and Artificial Intelligence for Improved Mobile Search Capabilities) was to develop and integrate revolutionary graphics rendering and artificial intelligence (AI) methods into an existing social media search engine platform, creating groundbreaking mobile search capabilities with significant online commercial potential. The project leveraged pioneering technologies developed at two academic institutions -- INSA de Lyon (LIRIS UMR CNRS 5205) and Trinity College Dublin (TCD) -- in collaboration with the industry partner Tapastreet. The aim was to commercialize innovative functionalities that enhance social media search capabilities, positioning Tapastreet as a leader in this domain.</p>

<p>GRAISearch was at the forefront of modern data processing and analysis techniques. Social media traffic and personal mobile usage continue to grow exponentially with advancements in portable devices and mobile transmission technologies such as WiFi, 4G, and 5G. Simultaneously, the volume of publicly shared media, particularly visual content, is increasing, as users transform into independent amateur broadcasters, sharing real-time, geo-located content. This wealth of user-generated media provides invaluable insights into global events and trends, offering potential benefits in diverse fields such as smart city planning, tourism, emergency rescue operations, and other scenarios requiring up-to-date, localized information.</p>

<p>The project focused on developing tools for smart mobile browsing, enabling data harvested from official APIs of social media streams to be merged, analyzed, visualized, and presented in a concise, user-friendly format. This data—geo-located, time-stamped, and inherently noisy, multi-modal, and heterogeneous—necessitated advanced visualization tools to extract actionable insights. Work Packages 1 and 2 investigated technologies for video summarization of social media-reported events, combining geo-location information with 3D mapping. Prototypes were successfully developed and demonstrated, accompanied by impactful publications.</p>

<p>One of the critical research challenges addressed by GRAISearch was event detection in social media streams, a field with high potential for applications in areas underserved by mainstream media. Work Packages 3 and 4 focused on real-time detection of local trends in geo-located social media streams. In collaboration with Tapastreet, INSA researchers developed "Gazouille," a system for discovering local events from such streams. Gazouille features three core modules:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Data acquisition from social networks across several urban areas.
    </li><li>Event detection using time-series analysis to identify patterns.
    </li><li>A web interface that presents real-time, city-specific events accompanied by galleries of related social media content.
    </li></ol>

<p>The system demonstrated superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method for geo-located event detection.</p>

<p>Work Package 5 explored recommender systems, optimizing their application to the Tapastreet platform. Work Package 6 addressed the integration of the project's research outcomes into the commercial platform, ensuring the seamless transition of innovative features into a market-ready product.</p>

<p>Through its innovations, GRAISearch laid the groundwork for transformative capabilities in social media analysis and mobile search. The project’s tools and methodologies hold immense promise for numerous applications, driving advancements in how localized, real-time social media information is processed, visualized, and utilized for commercial and societal benefit.</p>
